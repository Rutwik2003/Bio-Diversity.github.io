<p>
	The Fisheries Act of 1897 was a legislation passed by the British colonial government in India, which aimed to regulate and conserve fisheries resources in the country. The Act was primarily focused on inland fisheries and was applicable to all the territories under British India. The key provisions of the Fisheries Act of 1897 were as follows: <br><br>

          <ol>
              
		<li> <b><u>Licensing of fisheries</u></b>: The Act provided for the licensing of all fisheries, which meant that anyone who wished to fish in inland waters had to obtain a license from the government. The license fee varied depending on the size and type of the fishery.<br><br>
        </li>
           <li> <b><u> Prohibition of certain methods of fishing:</u></b> The Act prohibited the use of certain methods of fishing, such as poisoning or dynamiting the water, or using electricity to kill fish. These methods were considered harmful to fish stocks and could lead to the destruction of the ecosystem. <br><br>
           </li>
         <li>  <b><u>Protection of fish:</u></b> The Act made it illegal to catch fish that were below a certain size or to catch fish during their breeding season. These measures were aimed at ensuring that fish stocks were not depleted and that the fish could reproduce to maintain sustainable populations.<br><br></li>
           
           <li>  <b><u>Penalties for violations:</u></b> The Act provided for penalties for violations, including fines and imprisonment. Any person who violated the provisions of the Act could be fined up to Rs. 500 or sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or both. <br><br></li>
           
          <li> <b><u> Appointment of fishery officers:</u></b> The Act authorized the appointment of fishery officers, who were responsible for enforcing the provisions of the Act. These officers were empowered to search and seize any fishing gear or equipment used in violation of the Act and to prosecute offenders in court.<br><br>
          </li>
           <li> <b><u>Power to declare closed seasons:</u></b> The Act empowered the government to declare closed seasons during which fishing was prohibited. This measure was aimed at protecting fish during their breeding season and ensuring that they had a chance to reproduce and maintain healthy populations.<br><br></li>
           <li>  <b><u> Regulation of fishing gear</u></b>: The Act also regulated the use of fishing gear, including nets, hooks, and traps. Any fishing gear that was found to be harmful to fish or the ecosystem could be prohibited. <br><br></li>

          
			The Fisheries Act of 1897 was an important step towards the conservation and regulation of fisheries in India. However, over time, the Act became outdated and was replaced by newer legislation such as the Inland Fisheries (Regulation) Act of 1952 and the Marine Fisheries Regulation Act of 198 These Acts have further strengthened the regulation and conservation of fisheries resources in India.

        <p>
 This Act impacted the life of forest-dependent communities. The penalties and procedures given in this Act aimed to extend the state’s control over forests as well as diminishing the status of people’s rights to forest use.<br><br>
 The village communities were alienated from their age-old symbiotic association with forests. Further amendments were also made to restrain the local use of forests mainly by forest-dependent communities.<br><br>
It was enacted to make forest laws more effective and to improve the previous forest laws.<br><br><br>
	<ol>
        <li>To consolidate all the previous laws regarding forests.<br><br></li>

<li>To give the Government the power to create different classes of forests for their effective usage for the colonial purpose.<br><br></li>

<li>To regulate movement and transit of forest produce, and duty leviable on timber and other forest produce.<br><br></li>

<li>To define the procedure to be followed for declaring an area as Reserved Forest, Protected Forest or Village Forest.<br><br></li>

<li>To define forest offenses acts prohibited inside the Reserved Forest, and penalties leviable on the violation.<br><br></li>

<li>
    To make conservation of forests and wildlife more accountable.<br><br></li>

    </ol>

        </p>
<p>
			<u><b><h3>Types of Forest : </h3></b></u><br>
	<ol>
       <li> <b><u> Reserved Forests:</u></b><br><br>
        Reserve forests are the most restricted forests and are constituted by the State Government on any forest land or wasteland which is the property of the Government.
       In reserved forests, local people are prohibited, unless specifically allowed by a Forest Officer in the course of the settlement.<br><br></li>
<li><b><u>Protected Forests:</u></b> <br><br>
    The State Government is empowered to constitute any land other than reserved forests as protected forests over which the Government has proprietary rights and the power to issue rules regarding the use of such forests.
    This power has been used to establish State control over trees, whose timber, fruit or other non-wood products have revenue-raising potential.<br><br></li>
<li><b><u>Village forest:</u></b> <br><br>
    Village forests are the one in which the State Government may assign to ‘any village community the rights of Government to or over any land which has been constituted a reserved forest’.<br><br></li>
<li>
	<b><u> Degree of protection:</u></b> <br><br>
			Reserved forests > Protected forests > Village forests  </li>

        <p>
           The Environment (Protection) Act (EPA) was enacted in 1986 with the <br><br> objective of providing the protection and improvement of the environment.
It <br><br> empowers the Central Government to establish authorities charged with the <br><br>mandate of preventing environmental pollution in all its forms and to tackle <br><br>specific environmental problems that are peculiar to different parts of the country.<br><br>
			<br>

        </p>
        <p>
            <u><b>#History :</b></u><br><br>
			This act was enacted by the Parliament of India in 198 As the introduction says, "An Act to provide for the protection and improvement of environment and for matters connected therewith: Where as the decisions were taken at the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment held at Stockholm in June 1972, in which India participated, to take appropriate steps for the protection and improvement of human environment. Whereas it is considered necessary further to implement the decisions aforesaid in so far as they relate to the protection and improvement of environment and the prevention of hazards to human beings, other living creatures, plants and property"<br><br>
<u><b>Need for the Environment Protection Act in India: </b></u> <br><br>
	The need for stringent legislation for environment protection was felt in India because of the following reasons:<br><br>
			
 The first was the Stockholm Conference which highlighted internationally, the impact human activities were having on the environment.<br><br>
 Also, the need was felt because India had some laws for protecting the environment like the Air Act and Water Act but there was no comprehensive law that connected them and coordinated their activities and functions.<br><br>
			
			<u><b>#Aims and Objectives of the EPA:
</b></u><br><br>

The chief aims and objectives of the Environment Protection Act, 1986 are listed below.<br><br>
	<ol>
        		
			 <li>Implementing the decisions made at the United Nations Conference on Human Environment held in Stockholm.<br><br></li>
            <li> Creation of a government authority to regulate industry that can issue direct orders including closure orders.<br><br></li>
            <li> Enacting regular laws for the protection of the environment.<br><br></li>
             <li>Imposing punishments and penalties on those who endanger the environment, safety and health. <br><br></li>
            <li> Engaging in the sustainable development of the environment.<br><br></li>
             <li>Attaining protection of the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution.<br><br></li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
			<u><b>#Salient Features:</b></u><br><br>
			
			<ul>
                <li>The Environmental (Protection) Act, 1986 has its origins in the Indian Constitution's Article 48A (Directive Principles of State Policy) and Article 51A (g) (Fundamental Duties).<br><br></li>
              <li>  The Act empowers the Central Government to take all appropriate measures to prevent and control pollution, as well as to establish effective machinery for the purpose of protecting, improving, and controlling environmental pollution.<br><br></li>
                <li>The Environment (Protection) Act of 1986 relaxed the rule of "Locus Standi," and as a result, even a common citizen can approach the Court if he gives a sixty-day notice of the alleged offence and his intention to file a complaint with the Central Government or any other competent authority.<br><br></li>
            </ul>
			<h3><b><u>#Provisions:</u></b><br><br></h3>
			<ul>
               <li> <b><u>Pollutant Discharge Restrictions:</b></u><br> No individual or organisation shall discharge/emit or enable the discharge/emission of any environmental pollutant in excess of the statutory criteria.<br><br></li>
<li><b><u>Establishment of Environmental Labs:</u></b> <br> According to the Act, the Central Government has the authority to establish environmental laboratories.<br><br></li>
<li><b><u>Appointment of a Government Analyst:</u></b><br>  The Central Government appoints a Government Analyst to analyse samples of air, water, soil, or other substances delivered to a recognised environmental laboratory.<br><br></li>
<li><b><u>Penalties for Violations:</u></b><br> Non-compliance or violation of any of the Act's requirements is deemed an offence. Any violation of the EPA is punished by imprisonment for up to five years or a fine of up to one lakh rupees or both.<br><br></li>
<li><b><u>Offences Committed by Companies:</u></b><br> If a company commits an offence under this Act, every person directly in control of the firm at the time of the offence is presumed to be culpable unless proven otherwise.<br><br></li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            The Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 is an Act of the Parliament of India <br><br>enacted for protection of plants and animal species. Before 1972, India had <br><br>only five designated national parks. Among other reforms, the Act established scheduled protected plants and hunting certain animal species or harvesting these species was largely outlawed. The Act provides for the protection of wild animals, birds and plants; and for matters connected therewith or ancillary or incidental thereto. It extends to the whole of India.<br><br>

        </p>
		<br>
        <p>
           <b><u>#History of wildlife protection legislation in India:
</u></b><br><br>
			<ul><li> The first such law was passed by the British Indian Government in 1887 called the Wild Birds Protection Act, 1887. The law sought to prohibit the possession and sale of specified wild birds that were either killed or captured during a breeding session.<br><br></li>
			
             <li>   A second law was enacted in 1912 called the Wild Birds and Animals Protection Act. This was amended in 1935 when the Wild Birds and Animals Protection (Amendment) Act 1935 was passed.<br><br></li>
   <li> During the British Raj, wildlife protection was not accorded a priority. It was only in 1960 that the issue of protection of wildlife and the prevention of certain species from becoming extinct came into the fore. <br><br></li></ul>
			
			<h3><b><u>#Need for the Wildlife Protection Act:
            </u></b><br><br></h3>
			<p>
                Wildlife is a part of ‘forests’ and this was a state subject until the Parliament passed this law in 197 Now it is a Concurrent List. Reasons for a nationwide law in the domain of environment particularly wildlife include the following:<br><br></p>
			<ul>
                <li>India is a treasure-trove of varied flora and fauna. Many species were seeing a rapid decline in numbers. For instance, it was mentioned by Edward Pritchard Gee (A naturalist), that at the turn of the 20th century, India was home to close to 40000 tigers. But, a census in 1972 showed this number drastically reduced to about 1827.<br><br></li>
               <li> The most recent Act passed during the British era in this regard was the Wild Birds and Animals Protection, 193 This needed to be upgraded as the punishments awarded to poachers and traders of wildlife products were disproportionate to the huge financial benefits that accrue to them.<br><br></li>
               <li> There were only five national parks in India prior to the enactment of this Act.<br><br></li>
            </ul>
			
            <h3><b><u>#Authorities Appointed under the Act:</u></b><br><br></h3>
<ul>
    <li>The Central Government appoints the Director of Wildlife Preservation and assistant directors and other officers subordinate to the Director.<br><br></li>
   <li> The State Governments appoint a Chief Wildlife Warden (CWLW) who heads the Wildlife Wing of the department and exercises complete administrative control over Protected Areas (PAs) within a state.<br><br></li>
</ul>
			
			
<h3><b><u>#Schedules under the Act:</u></b><br><br></h3>
<p>
The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 has divided the protection status of various plants and animals under the following six schedules:<br><br>  
<b>Schedule I:</b><br><br>
 It covers endangered species that need rigorous protection. The species are granted protection from poaching, killing, trading etc.
 Species under this Schedule are prohibited to be hunted throughout India, except under threat to human life or in case of a disease that is beyond recovery.<br><br>
<b>Schedule II:</b><br><br>
Animals under this list are also accorded high protection with the prohibition on their trade.
They cannot be hunted except under threat to human life or if they are suffering from a disease/ disorder that goes beyond recovery.<br><br>
<b>Schedule III And IV:</b><br><br>
Species that are not endangered are included under Schedule III and IV.
This includes protected species with hunting prohibited but the penalty for any violation is less compared to the first two schedules.<br><br>
<b>Schedule V:</b><br><br>
			
			This schedule contains animals that are considered as vermin (small wild animals that carry disease and destroy plants and food). These animals can be hunted.
			<b>Schedule VI:</b><br><br>
It provides for regulation in cultivation of a specified plant and restricts its possession, sale and transportation.
Both cultivation and trade of specified plants can only be carried out with prior permission of competent authority.<br><br>
<b>Penalties (Section 51):</b><br><br>

   Project Tiger is a centrally sponsored scheme that offers support to the tiger states for the conservation of the species of tiger in recognized tiger reserves. 
On April 1, 1973, the Indian government introduced Project Tiger to encourage tiger conservation. The project is the largest species conservation programme of its kind.

<br><br>
		
		• Later, in 1973 Project Tiger was started, with Dr. Kailash Sankhala serving as its first director.<br><br>

• The first tiger reserve in India was the Jim Corbett Tiger Reserve in Uttarakhand. <br><br>

• Eight additional tiger reserves were created totaling over 9115 square kilometres of forest area. This area has increased to 71,000 square kilometres to date, a significant improvement from its early days but still not nearly enough forest cover for a developing nation like India with a stunning and extensive natural heritage. <br><br>

• In India, there are currently 53 tiger reserves. <br><br>

<b><u>Objectives of Project Tiger The important objectives of Project Tiger are listed below:</u></b><br><br>
 • To make sure that anything limiting the habitats for tigers is avoided. <br><br>

 • In order to maintain the equilibrium of the ecosystem, any harm done to these habitats should be rectified.<br><br>

 • Continue to have a healthy Tiger population. <br><br>



• The latest techniques include camera trapping and DNA fingerprinting. In the process of camera trapping, the photographers capture the different tigers which are then identified on the basis of the patterns of stripes on their bodies.<br><br> 
• The advanced technique of DNA fingerprinting helps in the identification of tigers using their faecal matter. <br><br>

• M-STriPES (Monitoring system for tigers-intensive protection and ecological status) stripes is an advanced application-based monitoring approach that was launched in the year 2010.<br><br>

				Project Elephant was launched in February, 1992 as centrally sponsored scheme to assist states having free ranging populations of wild elephants and to ensure long term survival of identified viable populations of elephants in their natural habitats.<br><br>
	Tiger faces threat of extinction, whereas the elephant faces threat of attrition.<br><br>
	The elephant numbers have not increased or decreased drastically but there is an increasing pressure on the elephant habitats.<br><br>
			<br><br>
			<b><u>Objectives :</u></b> <br><br>
  assist states having populations of wild elephants and to ensure long term survival of identified viable populations of elephants in their natural habitats
addressing man-animal conflict.<br><br>
			
 Developing scientific and planned management measures for conservation of elephants.
Protecting the elephants from poachers, preventing illegal ivory trade and other unnatural causes of death
Ecologically restoring the natural habitats and migratory routes of the elephants<br><br>
• Mitigation of the increasing conflicts<br><br>
• Developing scientific and planned management<br><br>
• Protecting the elephants from poachers<br><br>
• Researching on issues related to elephants and creating public awareness and education programs for it.<br><br>
• Eco-development and Veterinary care for the elephants.<br><br>
• It also aims at maintaining health care and breeding of tamed elephants.<br><br>
 The species is included in the list of protected species according to the Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 and in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna (CITES).<br><br>
 According to recent reports, the elephant population in India is demonstrating a stable trend across elephant reserves in India. The population of elephants in the year 2012, was estimated at 31,368 while it had fallen to 27312 in 2017. The elephant population of India was 27,682 in 2007.<br><br>  The average population throughout the period was about 26700.
As notified by the government, there are around 32 elephant Reserves in India. The very first elephant reserve or elephant sanctuary was the Singhbhum Elephant Reserve of Jharkhand. <br><br>

Haathi Mere Saathi is a campaign launched by the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) in partnership with the wildlife trust of India (WTI).<b> This campaign Is Based On "Hathi Mere Sathi" Film 1971 </b><br><br>
• To improve conservation and welfare prospects of the elephant – India’s National Heritage Animal.
The campaign was launched at the “Elephant- 8” Ministerial meeting held in Delhi on 24th May 201<br><br>
The E-8 countries are India, Botswana, the Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Tanza- nia, and Thailand.
This public initiative was to increase Awareness among people and develop friendship, companion- ship between people and elephants.<br><br>

<b><u>Elephant Task Force
</u></b><br><br>
				
 The increased tension due to rampant retaliatory killing of elephants and human-elephant conflict prompted the government to set up the Elephant Task Force along the lines of the Tiger Task Force. The focus of the Elephant Task Force was to bring pragmatic solutions for the conservation of elephants in the long-term.<br><br>
 The ETF was headed by a wildlife historian and political analyst, Dr Mahesh Rangarajan. And the other members included conservation and animal welfare activists, elephant biologists, and a veterinarian.<br><br>
 The World Elephant Day is celebrated on 12th August every year to spread awareness for the conservation and protection of the largest mammal on land.<br><br>
 The day was launched in 2012 to bring attention to the urgent plight of Asian and African elephants.
Asian Elephants: There are three subspecies of Asian elephant which are the Indian, Sumatran and Sri Lankan.<br><br> 
				
		-->	Global Population: Estimated 20,000 to 40,000.<br><br>
-->The Indian subspecies has the widest range and accounts for the majority of the remaining elephants on the continent.<br><br>
-->There are around 28,000 elephants in India with around 25% of them in Karnataka.<br><br>
-->IUCN Red List Status: Endangered.<br><br>
-->Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972: Schedule I.<br><br>
				
				<b>African Elephants:</b> There are two subspecies of African elephants, the Savanna (or bush) elephant and the Forest elephant.<br><br>

		 The Crocodile Conservation Project was launched in 1975 in different States.<br><br>
 The Gharial and Saltwater crocodile conservation programme was first implemented in Odisha in early 1975 and subsequently, the Mugger conservation programme was initiated.<br><br>
		<b><u>
		Crocodilians were threatened in India due to indiscriminate commercial killing and severe habitat loss until the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 197</u></b><br><br>


 By the 1970s, all three crocodile species (Gharial, Mugger crocodile, and Saltwater crocodile) in Odisha's river systems were on the verge of extinction.<br><br>


 Crocodiles were scarce due to increased human activity in rivers and other traditional habitats, resulting in a reduction in the extent of habitable stretches. In addition, predation reduces the survival rate of crocodile hatchlings in the wild.<br><br>


 From the 1960s onward, piecemeal efforts were made to save the crocodile.<br><br>


 Dr. H.R.Bustard, an FAO expert hired by UNDP/FAO and the Government of India, studied the prospects of crocodile rehabilitation, and a Crocodile Conservation Project was launched in 1975 in various states based on his report and guidance.
<br><br>

	<b><u>	 Objectives of Project Crocodile:</u></b><br><br>
		 Creating sanctuaries to protect the remaining crocodilians in their natural habitat.<br><br>


	 To quickly rebuild natural populations, more than 7000 crocodiles have been restocked, including 4000 gharial (Gavialis gangeticus), 1800 mugger (Crocodylus palustris), and 1500 saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus)<br><br>


	 To promote captive breeding.<br><br>


	 To conduct research to improve management.<br><br>


	 To increase the number of trained personnel on project sites through the (then) Central Crocodile Breeding and Management Training Institute in Hyderabad.<br><br>


	 Involve the community in the project on a personal level.<br><br>

  Project Rhino was launched in India in  2005 to protect and conserve the one horned rhinos.<br><br>

 The Indian Rhino Vision 2020 project aimed to achieve a wild population of at least 3,000 greater one-horned rhinos spread across seven protected areas in the Indian state of Assam by 2020.<br><br>  Kaziranga National Park, Pobitora National Park, Orang National Park, Manas National Park, Laokhowa Wildlife Sanctuary, Bura Chapori Wildlife Sanctuary, and Dibru Saikhowa Wildlife Sanctuary are the seven protected areas.<br><br>
		
		 The Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) is a rhinoceros species native to the Indian subcontinent. It is also known as the Indian rhino, greater one-horned rhinoceros, or great Indian rhinoceros.<br><br>

 The IUCN Red List classifies it as Vulnerable because populations are fragmented and limited to less than 20,000 km2 (7,700 sq mi). Furthermore, human and livestock encroachment is thought to be reducing the extent and quality of the rhino's most important habitat, the alluvial Terai-Duar savanna, grasslands, and riverine forest.<br><br>

 As of August 2018, the global population was estimated to be 3,588 people, including 2,939 in India and 649 in Nepal. In 2009, Kaziranga National Park alone had an estimated population of 2,048 rhinos. In 2009, the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary in Assam had the highest density of Indian rhinos in the world, with 84 individuals spread across 38.80 km2 (198 sq mi).<br><br>

 Indian rhinos once roamed the entire Indo-Gangetic Plain, but overhunting and agricultural development reduced their range to 11 locations in northern India and southern Nepal. In the early 1990s, it was estimated that between 1,870 and 1,895 Indian rhinos were still alive. Since then, the government's conservation efforts have resulted in an increase in population.<br><br>

 Poaching, however, remains a constant threat, with poachers killing over 150 Indian rhinos in Assam between 2000 and 200<br><br>

 Assam is home to nearly 85% of the world's Indian rhinoceros population, with Kaziranga National Park housing 70% of the rhino population.<br><br>

 In 1992, Singalila Wildlife Sanctuary (SNP), part of the eastern Himalayas in Darjeeling, West Bengal, was declared a national park.<br><br>
		Scientists have long debated the red panda's taxonomy. Red pandas were first described in 1825 as members of the raccoon family, because they have similar skulls, teeth and ringed tails.<br><br><br><br>
		
		<b><u>Explanation:-</u></b><br><br>	
 The red panda has reddish-brown fur, and long, shaggy tails. <br><br>
 They are slightly heavier than cats or roughly equal to the size of a cat.<br><br>
  It is also found in the mountains of Southern China and Myanmar.<br><br>  Red pandas are endangered mammals. <br><br>

	<p>
		
	&nbsp;  Project Cheetah was a wildlife conservation initiative launched by the Indian government in 1973 with the aim of reintroducing the cheetah to India. The cheetah is an iconic big cat that once roamed freely in India, but it became extinct in the country in the 1940s due to hunting, habitat loss, and other factors. The project aimed to reintroduce the cheetah from Africa to suitable habitats in India, such as the grasslands of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. <br><br>
		&nbsp;  The project was spearheaded by the Indian government's Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, and involved collaboration with international organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). <br><br>
		&nbsp;  The project involved extensive research and feasibility studies to determine the best sites for reintroducing the cheetah in India. The chosen sites were then prepared for the arrival of the cheetah, which involved creating suitable habitats and ensuring that the area was free from human and other disturbances.


<br><br>
		&nbsp;   The project also involved engaging with local communities and stakeholders to ensure their support and cooperation in the conservation of the cheetah. The government also provided training and support to forest department officials to manage and protect the cheetah populations. <br><br>
		&nbsp;  However, the project faced several challenges, including opposition from some conservationists who argued that resources should be focused on conserving existing endangered species rather than reintroducing extinct species. Additionally, there were concerns about the feasibility of reintroducing the cheetah to India, given the limited availability of suitable habitats and the potential for conflict with other species. 
<br><br>
		&nbsp;  In 2020, the Indian government announced that it was withdrawing its plan to reintroduce the cheetah to India due to concerns about the feasibility of the project. However, the government has continued to focus on the conservation of existing endangered species and their habitats.

	<p>
		
		&nbsp;Vultures, which feed on dead animals, were once the most common birds on the planet, including the Indian subcontinent. Until the 1980s, vultures were very common in India.<br><br>&nbsp; With India losing more than 95 percent of its vulture population between the 1990s and the mid-2000s, conservation efforts were urgently needed to prevent vultures from becoming extinct. <br><br>&nbsp;The Government of India launched Project Vulture in 2006 to increase the population of Indian vultures. <br><br>
		<br><br>
		<b><u>#Vulture in India:
</u></b><br><br>
		
		 --> In India, nine vulture species have been identified. Out of which, five belong to Genus Gypsy and the remaining four are monotypic.<br><br>
 --> Until the 1980s, vultures were very common in India.<br><br>
 --> The population of the three resident Gyps species (Oriental White-backed Vulture, Long-billed Vulture and Slender-billed Vulture) in the country was estimated to be 40 million individuals during this time period.<br><br>
 --> However, the overall population fell by more than 90% in the mid-1990s. By 2007, all three Gyps species had been exterminated.<br><br>
		
		<b><u>#Significance of Vultures in India:</u></b><br><br>
		
		 -->The scavenging lifestyle that has earned them a bad reputation is, in fact, what makes them so valuable to the environment, nature, and society.<br><br>
 -->Vultures that feed on dead animals assist areas in getting rid of carcasses that would otherwise provide foul odours and scenery for a much longer period of time, and are thus known as nature's cleanup crew.<br><br>
 -->Vultures also play an important role in the control of wildlife diseases.<br><br>
		
		<b><u>#Condition Without Vultures:</u></b><br><br>
&nbsp;  Other scavenging species' populations will be thrown off balance.<br><br>
&nbsp;  It will result in an increase in putrefying carcasses.<br><br>
&nbsp;  The movement of feral dogs into carcass dumps contributes to the spread of diseases like rabies and anthrax.<br><br>
&nbsp;  The traditional Parsi practise of burying their dead in 'Towers of Silence' for vultures to feed on will be affected.<br><br>

		<b><u>#Vulture Safety Zones (VSZ):</u></b><br><br>
&nbsp; The concept of a VSZ is unique to the Asian continent, but similar VSZs exist in Europe and Africa.<br><br>
&nbsp; The goal of developing VSZs is to establish targeted awareness activities within a 150-kilometre radius of vulture colonies so that no diclofenac or veterinary toxic drugs are found in cattle carcasses, the primary food source for vultures.<br><br>
		
		<b><u>#Vulture Breeding Centres in India:</u></b><br><br>
 -->In 2005, the vulture research facility in Pinjore, Haryana, was designated as Asia's first Vulture Conservation Breeding Centre.<br><br>
 -->India currently has four vulture breeding facilities located in Rani, Guwahati (Assam), Pinjore (Haryana), Buxa (West Bengal), and Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh).<br><br>
 -->The Central Zoo Authority (CZA) manages four more centres: Junagarh in Gujarat, Nandankanan in Orissa, Hyderabad in Telangana, and Muta in Ranchi.<br><br>
		
		<b><u>#Measures Taken to Conserve Vultures:</u></b><br><br>
&nbsp; The veterinary drug Diclofenac has been banned by the governments of India and Nepal.<br><br>
&nbsp; Meloxicam is being promoted as an effective replacement for vultures and other scavenging birds.<br><br>
&nbsp; The Government of India has developed a National Action Plan on Vulture Conservation (2006). The Action Plan outlines strategies and actions for mitigating vulture population declines through ex-situ and in-situ vulture conservation.<br><br>
&nbsp; White-backed, Long-billed, and Slender-billed Vultures have been moved from Schedule IV to Schedule I of the Wild Life (Protection) Act of 197<br><br>
&nbsp; Vulture Protection Zones have been created.<br><br>
&nbsp; Sites for Vulture Restaurants have been identified and in operation.<br><br>
&nbsp;7. State governments have been advised to establish vulture care centres in order to conserve three species of vultures.<br><br>
<b><u>#India’s Role in Conservation of vulture:</u></b><br><br>
In 2004, India introduced a motion in the IUCN for vulture conservation, which was accepted in the form of an IUCN resolution.<br><br>
It called on Gyps vulture range countries to take action to prevent all uses of diclofenac in veterinary applications.

	<p>
		
			&nbsp;Project snow leopard is the government of India's flagship program launched <br><br>in 2009 by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change on slow <br><br>leopard conservation that aims to strengthen the unique natural heritage of <br><br> India's high altitude wildlife population and their habitats by promoting<br><br> conservation through participatory policies and actions.<br><br><br><br><br>	
		
	 --> They are found in the high altitude Himalayan & trans-Himalayan Region at over 2700m above sea level.<br><br>
 -->The Snow Leopard, also known as the 'ounce,' is a large member of the cat family native to the mountain ranges of Central and South Asia.<br><br>
 -->It is easily identified by its distinctive white fur, which gives rise to its eponymous name.<br><br>
		
<b><u>Top 3 Indian National Parks where the Snow Leopard is likely to be spotted:</u></b><br><br>
		
		  Kibber Wildlife Sanctuary - Himachal Pradesh<br><br>
  Ulley Valley - Ladakh<br><br>
  Hemis National Park - Himachal Pradesh<br><br>

<b><u>#Objectives:</u></b><br><br>
 => To protect and conserve India's unique natural heritage of high-altitude wildlife populations and habitats through conservation policies and actions that encourage participation.<br><br>
 => It aims to promote a knowledge-based and adaptive conservation framework that fully involves local communities in conservation efforts that share the snow leopard's range.<br><br>
 => Project Snow Leopard is intended for all biologically significant habitats within the snow leopard's range, regardless of ownership (e.g. Protected Areas, common land, etc.).<br><br>
<b><u>#Protection Status:</u></b><br><br>
		
 => The snow leopard is classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN-World Conservation Union's Red List of Threatened Species.<br><br>
 => It is listed in Schedule I of the Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972, Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), and Appendix I of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS).<br><br>

		The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) downgraded the snow leopard's conservation status to "vulnerable" from "endangered" in September 2017.<br><br>
<b><u>#Snow Leopard Conservation in India:</u></b><br><br>
		
 => India is home to an estimated 10% of the global Snow Leopard population, which is spread across five Himalayan states: Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh, accounting for only 5% of the animal's available global habitat.<br><br>
 => India has been conserving the snow leopard and its habitat through the Project Snow Leopard (PSL).<br><br>
 => Since 2013, India has also been a participant in the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Protection (GSLEP) Programme.<br><br>

		<b><u>#Global Conservation Efforts:</u></b><br><br>
 => The Bishkek Declaration of 2013 established a goal of protecting at least 20 snow leopard landscapes with viable snow leopard populations by 2020.<br><br>
 => It resulted in the establishment of the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Protection Program (GSLEP).<br><br>
 => The GSLEP is a high-level inter-governmental alliance of all 12 countries in the snow leopard range.<br><br>
 => It primarily emphasises the importance of raising awareness and understanding of the Snow Leopard's importance to the ecosystem.<br><br>

	<p>
 => Great Indian Bustards Are The Rare Species Only Can Be Seen In Rajasthan <br><br>
	 => The great Indian bustard can easily be distinguished by its black crown on the forehead contrasting with the pale neck and head.<br><br>
		 => The biggest threat to this species is hunting, which is still prevalent in Pakistan.<br><br>
		 => This is followed by occasional poaching outside Protected Areas, collisions with high tension electric wires, fast moving vehicles and free-ranging dogs in villages.<br><br>
		 =Other threats include habitat loss and alteration as a result of widespread agricultural expansion and mechanized farming, infrastructural development such as irrigation, roads, electric poles, as well as mining and industrialization<br><br>
		 => Listed in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, in Appendix I of CITES, as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List, the GIBs enjoy the highest protection both in India and globally. The earliest estimates show the population was about 1,260 in 1969, but has declined by 75% in the last 30 years.<br><br>
		 => According to scientists, the GIBs are slow breeders and they build their nests on the ground. The species have also been subjected to hunting and egg collection in the past.<br><br>
		 => There also has been a decline in prevailing habitat loss as dry grasslands have been diverted for other use. <br><br>
		 => Experts also warn of pesticide contamination and increase of populations of free-ranging dogs and pigs along with native predators (fox, mongoose, and cat), putting pressure on nests and chicks. <br><br>
