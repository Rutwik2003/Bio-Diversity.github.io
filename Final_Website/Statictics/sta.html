<h2>Endangered &amp; Endemic Species in India</h2>
<p> An endangered species is a plant or animal species that is at risk
of becoming extinct in the near future. The International Union for
Conservation of Nature (IUCN) defines an endangered species as one that
has a very high risk of extinction in the wild, while a critically
endangered species is one that is facing an extremely high risk of
extinction. A species may be designated as endangered for a variety of
reasons, including habitat destruction, overhunting, introduction of
non-native species, pollution, and climate change. <br>
<br>
An endemic species is a plant or animal species that is found only in a
particular geographic region and nowhere else in the world. These
species are uniquely adapted to their specific environment and are
often highly specialized, which makes them particularly vulnerable to
habitat loss and other threats. Endemic species can occur at any
taxonomic level, from individual populations to entire genera or
families, and they can be found in a wide range of habitats, including
forests, deserts, and islands.<br>

<p> The Bengal tiger, also known as the Royal Bengal tiger, is a tiger
subspecies native to the Indian subcontinent. It is one of the most
iconic and majestic animals in the world, with its distinctive orange
coat and black stripes. </p>
<br>
<p> Habitat: The Bengal tiger's habitat is primarily in India, but they
can also be found in other countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, and
Nepal. They prefer to live in dense forests, grasslands, and wetlands
where they can hunt their prey. </p>
<br>
<p>Behaviour: Bengal tigers are solitary animals, and each individual
has its own territory. They are known for their strength, agility, and
intelligence, and are considered to be apex predators. They are also
excellent swimmers and are known to hunt in water. </p>
<br>
<p>Conservation Status: The Bengal tiger is listed as endangered by the
International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to habitat
loss, poaching, and human-tiger conflict. Conservation efforts have
been made to protect the species, including the creation of national
parks and the enforcement of stricter wildlife protection laws. </p>

<p> The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) is a large, solitary cat native
to the mountainous regions of Central Asia, including the Himalayas,
Tibet, and the ltai Mountains. They are known for their distinctive
white-gray fur with black spots and their powerful build, adapted to
the harsh conditions of their high-altitude habitats. </p>
<br>
<p> Snow leopards are perfectly adapted to their cold, mountainous
environments. They have long, thick fur that insulates them from the
cold, and large, furry paws that help them walk on snow and ice. </p>
<br>
<p> sSnow leopards are carnivorous and primarily feed on wild sheep,
goats, and other ungulates. They are also known to eat small mammals,
such as marmots and pikas, and occasionally birds. </p>
<br>
<p> Efforts are underway to conserve snow leopards and their habitats.
Conservation initiatives include anti-poaching patrols, community
education programs, and the establishment of protected areas. </p>

<br>
<p> Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) are majestic and intelligent
mammals that are native to Asia, specifically found in 13 countries
including India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Malaysia. </p>
<p> They are slightly smaller than their African counterparts, with a
shoulder height of up to 3 meters and a weight of up to 5,500 kg. Asian
elephants have distinctive features such as smaller ears, a more arched
back, and a single "finger" at the tip of their trunk, which they use
for grasping objects. <br>
<br>
These elephants are herbivores and feed on a variety of vegetation,
including grasses, leaves, bark, and fruits. They are social animals,
living in groups led by a dominant female, and communicate with each
other using various vocalizations and body language.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p> Unfortunately, Asian elephants are listed as endangered on the IUCN
Red List due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-elephant conflict.
Conservation efforts are underway to protect these magnificent animals
and their habitats. </p>

<p> The red panda is a small arboreal mammal found in the forests of
India, Nepal, Bhutan, and the northern mountains of Myanmar and
southern China. </p>
<p> It thrives best at 2,200-4,800m in mixed deciduous and conifer
forests with dense understories of bamboo, though red panda evidences
have also been found at 1800m. <br>
<br>
In India, this elusive species is found in Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh,
Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts of West Bengal. It is the state
animal of Sikkim. <br>

    <p>The species is locally known as Varaiaadu.
        It was designated as the State animal of Tamil Nadu in recognition of its ecological and cultural significance. </p>
    <p>It has become locally extinct in around 14% of its traditional shola forest-grassland habitat.
        Population: It is estimated that there are 3,122 Nilgiri Tahrs in the wild.
        October 7 will be celebrated as Nilgiri Tahr Day in honour of E.R.C. Davidar.
         </p><br>
    <p>Habits and Lifestyle <br>
        Nilgiri tahrs are social animals and live in herds that may consist of 6 individuals or as large as 100-150; these herds may be mixed or contain only males or only adult females and their young. Nilgiri tahrs are active between dawn and dusk. 
        Nilgiri tahrs have very acute eyesight and are able to spot danger at a far distance; with any sight of a danger, they produce an alarm call that sounds as a snort or whistle.
         </p><br>
    <p>Diet and Nutrition <br>
        Nilgiri tahrs are herbivores (graminivores, folivores). They feed on various grasses, shrubs, leaves, and forbs.
