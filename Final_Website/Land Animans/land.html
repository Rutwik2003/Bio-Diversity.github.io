    <h2>Cheetah:</h2><br>
    <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/01/152301-050-1EF6EBB4/Cheetah.jpg" alt="" srcset="" width="400" height="250px" ><br><br>

    <p> 
        <li>
        There are three stages in the life cycle of the cheetah: cub (birth to 18 months), adolescence (18 to 24 months) and adult life (24 months and on).</li><br>
        <li>The gestation (pregnancy) period for the cheetah is 93 days, and litters range in size from one or two up to six cubs (the occasional litter of eight cubs has been recorded, but it is rare).
        </li><br> 
        <li>Cub mortality is higher in protected areas like national parks and wildlife reserves where proximity to large predators is greater than in non-protected areas.</li><br> 
        <li>In such areas, the cheetah cub mortality can be as high as 90%.Adult life for a cheetah in the wild is difficult. Cheetahs in the wild (both male and female combined) have an average age span of 10 – 12 years.</li><br>
        <li>The average lifespan of an adult male in the wild skews lower (8 years), due in part to territorial conflicts with competing groups of males. Adult mortality is one of the most significant limiting factors for the growth and survival of the wild cheetah population.
        </li>

    <ul class="listcontent">
    <p>
        <li>
        Adult cheetahs’ weight averages between 75 and 125 pounds. They can measure from 40 to 60 inches in length, measured from the head to the hind quarters. The tail can add a further 24 to 32 inches bringing the total overall length up to 7.5 feet.</li><br>
        <li>On average, cheetahs stand 28 to 36 inches tall at the shoulder.The cheetah is a sexually dimorphic species though it is difficult to identify cheetahs’ sex by appearance alone. Male cheetahs are slightly bigger than females and they have larger heads, 
        but they do not display the same degree of physical difference between the sexes of other big cat species like lions. Cheetahs have a thin frame with a narrow waist and deep chest.</li><br>
        <li>With its long legs and very slender body, the cheetah is quite different from all other cats and is the only member of its genus, Acinonyx. The cheetah’s unique morphology and physiology allow it to attain the extreme speeds for which it’s famous.
    </li>

    <ul class="listcontent">
    <p>
        <li>The cheetah’s undercoat ranges in color from light tan to a deep gold and is marked by solid black spots. These spots are not open like the rosettes found on a leopard or jaguar’s coat, which is one way to quickly identify the cheetah.</li><br>
        <li>Distinctive black tear stripes run from the eyes to the mouth. The stripes are thought to protect the eyes from the sun’s glare. It is believed that they have the same function as a rifle scope, helping cheetahs focus on their prey at a long distance range by minimizing the glare of the sun.
        </li><br>
         <li>These markings provide them with excellent camouflage while hunting and make them more difficult for other predators to detect. The tail is also thought to be a signaling device, helping young cubs follow their mothers in tall grass. The tip of the tail varies in color from white to black among individuals.

    <h2>Lion:</h2>

    <ul class="listcontent">
<p>
    <li>The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and short legs. Size and appearance vary considerably between the sexes. The male’s outstanding characteristic is his mane, which varies between different individuals and populations.</li><br>
    <li>It may be entirely lacking; it may fringe the face; or it may be full and shaggy, covering the back of the head, neck, and shoulders and continuing onto the throat and chest to join a fringe along the belly. In some lions the mane and fringe are very dark, almost black, giving the cat a majestic appearance.</li><br>
    <li>The lion’s coat is short and varies in colour from buff yellow, orange-brown, or silvery gray to dark brown, with a tuft on the tail tip that is usually darker than the rest of the coat.</li>
</p></ul><br><br>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Lion_waiting_in_Namibia.jpg/1200px-Lion_waiting_in_Namibia.jpg" alt="" srcset="" width="400" height="250px" ><br><br>
<ul class="listcontent">
<p>
    <li>The group may consist of as few as 4 or as many as 37 members, but about 15 is the average size. Each pride has a well-defined territory consisting of a core area that is strictly defended against intruding lions and a fringe area where some overlap is tolerated. Where prey is abundant, a territory area may be as small as 20 square km (8 square miles), but if game is sparse, it may cover up to 400 square km.
    </li><br>
    <li>There are a number of competing evolutionary explanations for why lions form groups. Large body size and high density of their main prey probably make group life more efficient for females in terms of energy expenditure.</li><br> <li>Groups of females, for example, hunt more effectively and are better able to defend cubs against infanticidal males and their hunting territory against other females.</li><br>
    <li>The relative importance of these factors is debated, and it is not clear which was responsible for the establishment of group life and which are secondary benefits.</li>

<ul class="listcontent">
<p>
    <li>Lions prey on a large variety of animals ranging in size from rodents and baboons to Cape (or African) buffalo and hippopotamuses, but they predominantly hunt medium- to large-sized hoofed animals such as wildebeests, zebras, and antelopes.</li><br>
    <li>Lions are known to take elephants and giraffes, but only if the individual is young or especially sick. They readily eat any meat they can find, including carrion and fresh kills that they scavenge or forcefully steal from hyenas, cheetahs, or wild dogs. Lionesses living in open savanna do most of the hunting, whereas males typically appropriate their meals from the female’s kills.</li><br>
</p>
<p>
     <li>During this time a pair generally mates every 20–30 minutes, with up to 50 copulations per 24 hours. Such extended copulation not only stimulates ovulation in the female but also secures paternity for the male by excluding other males. The gestation period is about 108 days, and the litter size varies from one to six cubs, two to four being usual.</li>

        <li>Giraffe, (genus Giraffa), any of four species in the genus Giraffa of long-necked cud-chewing hoofed mammals of Africa, with long legs and a coat pattern of irregular brown patches on a light background. Giraffes are the tallest of all land animals; males (bulls) may exceed 5.5 metres (18 feet) in height, and the tallest females (cows) are about 4.5 metres.</li><br>
        <li>Using prehensile tongues almost half a metre long, they are able to browse foliage almost six metres from the ground. Giraffes are a common sight in grasslands and open woodlands in East Africa, where they can be seen in reserves such as Tanzania’s Serengeti National Park and Kenya’s Amboseli National Park. The genus Giraffa is made up of the northern giraffe (G. camelopardalis), the southern giraffe (G. giraffa), the Masai giraffe (G. tippelskirchi), and the reticulated giraffe (G. reticulata).</li><br>
         <li>Males weigh up to 1,930 kg (4,250 pounds), females up to 1,180 kg (2,600 pounds). The tail may be a metre in length and has a long black tuft on the end; there is also a short black mane. Both sexes have a pair of horns, though males possess other bony protuberances on the skull.</li><br>

        <li>Elephant, (family Elephantidae), largest living land animal, characterized by its long trunk (elongated upper lip and nose), columnar legs, and huge head with temporal glands and wide, flat ears.
        Elephants are grayish to brown in colour, and their body hair is sparse and coarse. They are found most often in savannas, grasslands, and forests but occupy a wide range of habitats, including deserts, swamps, and highlands in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia.</li><br>
        <li>The African savanna, or bush, elephant (Loxodonta africana) weighs up to 8,000 kg (9 tons) and stands 3 to 4 metres (10 to 13 feet) at the shoulder. The African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), which lives in rainforests, was recognized as a separate species in 2000 and is smaller than the savanna elephant. It has slender, downward-pointing tusks.</li>
        <li>The common belief that there existed “pygmy” and “water” elephants has no basis; they are probably varieties of the African forest elephants.</li><br>
    </p></ul><br><br>

    <ul class="listcontent">
    <p>
        <li>The Asian elephant (Elephas maximus) weighs about 5,500 kg and has a shoulder height of up to 3.5 metres. The Asian elephant includes three subspecies: the Indian, or mainland (E. maximus indicus), the Sumatran (E. maximus sumatranus), and the Sri Lankan (E. maximus maximus). African elephants have much larger ears, which are used to dissipate body heat.</li><br>
        <li>This structure is unique to members of the order Proboscidea, which includes the extinct mastodons and mammoths.</li><br>
        <li>The trunk is large and powerful, weighing about 130 kg (290 pounds) in an adult male and capable of lifting a load of about 250 kg. However, it is also extremely dexterous, mobile, and sensitive, which makes it appear almost independent of the rest of the animal.</li><br>

    <ul class="listcontent">
    <p>
        <li>The proboscis comprises 16 muscles. A major muscle covering the top and sides functions to raise the trunk; another covers the bottom.  A total of nearly 150,000 muscle fascicles have been counted in cross sections of trunk.</li><br>
        <li>At the end of the trunk are flaplike projections enabling it to perform amazingly delicate functions, such as picking up a coin from a flat surface or cracking a peanut open, blowing away the shell, and putting the kernel in the mouth. An Asian elephant most often curls the tip of its trunk around an item and picks it up in a method called the “grasp,” whereas the African elephant uses the “pinch,” picking up objects in a manner similar to that of a human’s use of the thumb and index finger.</li><br>

    <p>
        <li>Of the more than 800 cattle breeds recognized worldwide, India had 27 acknowledged indigenous breeds of cattle and 7 breeds of buffaloes. As of 2018 the ICAR recognized 50 breeds that are indigenous in India,of which two cattle breeds and three buffalo breeds were added in 2018.Local conservation programs are endeavouring to maintain the purity of breeds such as Tharparkar,dwarf cattle such as Kasaragod, and Kankrej, Amrit Mahal and Kangayam.</li><br>
        <li>On the basis of main uses Indigenous cattle breeds are classified in to milch (cow and buffalloes for milk), draft (load carrying such as ox), and dual purpose (i.e. milk and draf)</li><br>

         Some of the Indigenous cattle breeds of India:<br><br>
         <li>Gir: The Gir is distinctive in appearance, typically having a rounded and domed forehead (being the only ultraconvex breed in the world), long pendulous ears and horns which spiral out and back.It has been used locally in the improvement of other breeds including the Red Sindhi and the Sahiwal.
         </li><br>
         <li>Gir are generally mottled with the colour ranging from red through yellow to white, black being the only unacceptable colour. They originated in west India in the state of Gujarat and have since spread to neighbouring Maharashtra and Rajasthan.</li>

        <li>With the introduction of irrigation systems to the region they began to be kept in smaller numbers by the farmers of the region, who used them as draught and dairy animals. Today the Sahiwal is one of the best dairy breeds in India and Pakistan.</li><br>
        <li>Sahiwal is calm when milking. Due to their heat tolerance and high milk production they have been exported to other Asian countries as well as Africa and the Caribbean.</li>

        <li>The largest of the big cats, tigers are truly impressive animals with their black-striped orange fur and white bellies.
        The tiger is the largest member of the felid (cat) family. Tiger taxonomy was revised in 2017 based on new genetic analysis into two subspecies: Panthera tigris tigris, consisting of tiger populations in continental Asia, and Panthera tigris sondaica, including populations in the Sunda Islands.</li><br>
        <li>You’ve probably heard that lions are the kings of the jungle, but did you know that lions don’t actually live in the jungle? It’s time they handed their crown to the real King of the Cats: Tigers. They’re bigger, stronger, and heavier than all other cats (including lions). Plus, they really do live in the jungle — in Asia, to be exact. One tiger can weigh as much as 300 kilograms and can grow as long as 2.8 metres (as long as a small car).</li>

        <li>They have fake eyes called “ocelli”. These white spots of fur on the back of each ear scare other animals. It looks like the tiger is watching them, even when its head is turned the other way or it’s sleeping.</li><br>
        <li>They may be big and heavy but they’re not slow! At full speed, these felines can reach up to 65km/h and roam as far as 30 kms a night in search of food. That’s why they need to live in large areas, full of trees, with plenty of water to drink and prey to eat.</li><br>
        <li>Fossil remains of tigers were found in China and estimated to be two million years old. That’s as old as the earliest human fossils ever found. (A fossil is the preserved remains of a living plant, animal or insect that died a long time ago).</li><br>

    <p>
        <li>Tigers face many threats. Their greatest threat is large scale loss of habitat and prey due to human encroachment and habitat degradation for agriculture. Climate change is also causing ocean levels to rise, reducing coastal habitat in areas like India’s Sunderban islands and forcing tigers to move into areas more heavily populated by people.</li><br>
        <li>In some parts of their range, tigers are poached because their pelts are valuable in the black market trade in Asia and their other body parts are used in traditional Asian medicine. Tigers are also killed or removed from the wild in efforts to protect livestock and human communities.</li><br>
        <li>Tigers are critically endangered. In the last 100 years, 97% of wild tigers have vanished. They’re hunted by poachers for their pelts, meat and body parts and their wild homes are destroyed. If we don’t act fast then the forests of the future will be empty of these beautiful big cats forever.</li>

    <p>
        <li>White, Black, Indian, Javan, and Sumatran make up the five species of rhino in the world. White and black rhinoceros are native to Africa, while Indian, Javan and Sumatran can be found in India and Asia. Due to widespread poaching, all rhinos are under threat, but the black rhino, Javan rhino and Sumatran rhino are classified as critically endangered and could become extinct in as few as three generations.</li><br>
        <li>Despite its appearance, a rhino horn is not made of bone, instead the core substance of rhino horn is a protein called keratin, the same substance found in the fingernails and hair of many mammals (including humans). Keratin in a rhino horn is a compacted mass of hairs that grows throughout the life of a rhino.</li><br>
        <li>For rhinos, snorts signal anger, huffs are greetings, while surprised squeaks often mean confusion. In addition to these forms of communication, rhino droppings are also meaningful. By smelling rhino droppings, rhinos can identify a variety of characteristics about its owner including the sex and approximate age of the rhino. The location of the droppings also marks territory for different groups of rhino.</li><br>
    </p><br><br>

    <p>
        <li>Africa’s white rhino, the largest of the world’s five species of rhinos, can weigh in at 5,000 pounds, making it the world’s second largest land mammal behind elephants. All that weight is distributed across a 6 foot tall frame that can reach up to 11 feet in length.</li><br>
        <li>Ancestors of today’s rhinos roamed the earth 50 million years ago and though the rhinos of today share many similarities to their forebears, the thick, curly coat of hair found on the woolly rhino is not one of them!</li><br>
        <li>Rhinos make up for their poor eyesight—they sometimes have trouble visually detecting other animals on an open plain who are less than a hundred feet away—with their olfactory (smell) and auditory (hearing) senses. In fact, the largest part of the rhino brain is dedicated to the olfactory sense, indicating just how important a rhino’s sense of smell is to its survival.</li><br>
    </p><br><br>

    <p>
        <li>Rhinos are famous for their horns, and they were named for their signature feature. But the moniker isn’t super creative. The word rhinoceros is a literal mix of two Greek words that best describe how they look: rhino (nose) and ceros (horn).</li><br>
        <li>For their size, you’d suspect that they’re big meat eaters. But they’re vegetarians that can eat up to 100 pounds of food a day. Depending on the species, they eat leaves, fruit, grasses, stems, and twigs.</li><br>
        <li>Rhinos’ habitats include tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas and shrublands, tropical moist forests, deserts and shrublands are among their habitats. Their habitat depends on the species. For example, the Sumatran rhino’s habitat is dense highland and lowland tropical and subtropical forests. Meanwhile, the white rhino can be found in African grasslands.</li><br>
        <li>Female rhinos give birth to a single calf, which can weigh over 100 pounds. Rhino breeding patterns depend on the species and its habitat. The mother may stay with her calf for up to four years unless she has another baby, in which case she pushes her older calf into independence to make way for the new arrival.</li><br>

            <li>Wolves are the largest members of the dog family.
            Wolves can sprint from 36-38 miles  for short distances.In the wild, wolves can live up to 13 years and up to 16 years in captivity.</li><br>
            <li>The main threat to wolf survival is habitat loss due to destruction, development, and encroachment of humans. They are also threatened due to persecution by humans.
            Wolf pups are born in the Spring and they live with their mother in the den until they are about 3 weeks old.All wolves in a pack help raise and take care of the pups.</li><br>

            <li>Wolf weights vary. They can weigh from 40 to 175 pounds.
            Wolves howl to communicate. if alone, a wolf may howl to attract the attention of his pack. Packs howl together to send territorial messages from one pack to another.</li><br>
            <li>Wolves can roam large and long distances, sometimes up to 12 miles (20 kilometers) in a single day.
            Wolves prefer to eat large animals like deer, elk, and moose. One wolf can eat 20 pounds (9 kilograms) of meat at a single sitting.</li><br>
            <li>While the average length of female wolves is 4.5 to 6 feet from nose to tail, males can grow up to 6.5 feet in length. This is partly why they can sprint at speeds of 36 to 38 miles per hour for short distances, though unless they are on the chase they tend to cruise at a more leisurely pace of about 5 mph.</li>

        <p>
            <li>The wolf is mainly a carnivore and feeds on large wild mammals as well as smaller animals, livestock, carrion and garbage. Single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs.</li><br>
            <li>Once a wolf has found a mate, they tend to stay together for better or worse, through sickness and health, often until death due them part. Of course it is typically only the alpha male and female that breed, leaving the rest of the adult pack members to help rear the young and ensure their survival.</li>

    <ul class="listcontent">
    <p>
        <li>Horses are obligate nasal breathers. This means that they are unable to breathe through their mouth as humans can. Horses can only breathe through their nose.</li><br>
        <li>Horses have a “stay-apparatus” which is a system of tendons and ligaments that allows the horse to lock their legs in position so they can relax without falling over. When not sleeping, horses also use this apparatus to rest while standing for long periods of time. This allows them to conserve energy while standing so they are ready to take flight if needed. It is a myth that horses never lay down – they do spend a short amount of time each day laying down for deeper sleep. On average, horses sleep two and a half hours per day.</li><br>
        <li>As a prey animal, horses need to have sensitive hearing to survive. Humans have only three muscles to control their ears, whereas horses have 10! This allows horses to rotate their ears nearly 180 degrees and move them independently of one another. Being able to rotate their ears lets horses hear sounds all around them without having to turn their head.</li>
    </p><br><br>
    <img src="https://pikwizard.com/pw/small/36b593e928051aead93f9d4ae4ec16e1.jpg" alt="" srcset="" width="400" height="250px" ><br><br>
    <p>
        <li>This is due to the positioning of their eyes on the sides of their head. However, they have two blind spots – one directly behind them, and the other directly in-front of their head. This means that they cannot see the grass they are grazing on, or the carrot you are sticking out to them! Instead, they will move their head or use their mobile and sensitive lips, whiskers and sense of smell to know what is in-front of them.</li><br>
        <li>As a prey animal, horses need to react quickly should a flight-or-fight situation arise. When they need to fight, horses can go from standing still to delivering a powerful kick in just 0.3 seconds, whereas human reaction time is 1.6 seconds.</li><br>
        <li>Foals are relatively mature and mobile from birth. Foals are most vulnerable to predators after birth, so they must be able to flee from danger if necessary.</li><br>
        <li>They can be taught many different tasks through positive reinforcement and clicker training, just as dogs can. One study showed that horses have the ability to communicate their needs to their guardians; these horses learned to communicate whether they wanted a blanket on or off through touching symbols on a board.</li><br>

    <p>
        <li>Horses can be spotted, have patches of colour, or be one main colour with different colours on their face or legs. Each of these horse colours has a unique name. Like dogs, the breed of the horse will influence their colour.</li><br>
        <li>This ancestor was only the size of a Labrador retriever! Horses were domesticated around 6000 years ago, estimated from evidence found at archaeological sites.</li><br>
        <li>Horses find safety in a herd and form strong social relationships with each other. They use their senses to recognize familiar horses and spend time with those they have formed friendships with. In the herd, one horse will stand guard to keep watch while the other horses in the herd take time to eat, rest and sleep.</li>

        <li>It is listed by the IUCN as near-threatened, as the global population is estimated to be under 10,000 mature individuals which continues to experience deliberate and incidental persecution along with a decrease in its prey base such that it may come close to meeting a continuing decline of 10% over the next three generations.</li>

    <p>
        <li>It is the smallest of the bone-cracking hyenas and retains many primitive viverrid-like characteristics lost in larger species,having a smaller and less specialised skull.Though primarily a scavenger, large specimens have been known to kill their own prey,and attacks on humans have occurred in rare instances.The striped hyena is a monogamous animal, with both males and females assisting one another in raising their cubs.</li><br>
        <li>A nocturnal animal, the striped hyena typically only emerges in complete darkness, and is quick to return to its lair before sunrise.Although it has a habit of feigning death when attacked, it has been known to stand its ground against larger predators in disputes over food.</li>

    <p>
        <li>The striped hyena features prominently in Middle Eastern and Asian folklore. In some areas, its body parts are considered magical, and are used as charms or talismans.</li><br>
        <li>The striped hyena has a fairly massive, but short torso set on long legs. The hind legs are significantly shorter than the forelimbs, thus causing the back to slope downwards. The legs are relatively thin and weak, with the forelegs being bent at the carpal region. The neck is thick, long and largely immobile, while the head is heavy and massive with a shortened facial region.</li><br>
        <li>The eyes are small, while the sharply pointed ears are very large, broad and set high on the head. Like all hyenas, the striped hyena has bulky pads on its paws, as well as blunt but powerful claws.</li>

    <h2>Kangaroo :</h2>

    <ul class="listcontent">
    <p>
        <li>kangaroo, any of six large species of Australian marsupials noted for hopping and bouncing on their hind legs. The term kangaroo, most specifically used, refers to the eastern gray kangaroo, the western gray kangaroo, and the red kangaroo, as well as to the antilopine kangaroo and two species of wallaroo (see below).</li><br>
        <li>In its broadest usage, kangaroo refers to any member of the family Macropodidae, which comprises about 65 species, including tree kangaroos and the quokka; rat kangaroos are classified into “sister” familes, Potoroidae and Hypsiprymnodontidae.</li><br>
        <li>With the exception of tree kangaroos (genus Dendrolagus), all members of the kangaroo family (Macropodidae) rely on long, powerful hind legs and feet for hopping and leaping, their predominant forms of locomotion. Their long tails, thickened at the base, are used for balancing. This feature is most obvious in the large kangaroos, which use the tail as a third leg when standing still.</li> 
    </p><br><br>
    <img src="https://th-thumbnailer.cdn-si-edu.com/V408Xd8N2y92XNQ05rRH4nu1LR0=/fit-in/1600x0/https://tf-cmsv2-smithsonianmag-media.s3.amazonaws.com/filer/df/a9/dfa966b8-9bb4-426e-ade1-98c2a982b59f/6754298445_3918332c9e_o.jpg" alt="" srcset="" width="400" height="250px" ><br><br>
    <p>
        <li>In all species, the marsupium (or pouch) is well developed, opens forward, and contains four teats. The young kangaroo (“joey”) is born at a very immature stage, when it is only about 2 cm (1 inch) long and weighs less than a gram (0.04 ounce). Immediately after birth, it uses its already clawed and well-developed forelimbs to crawl up the mother’s body and enter the pouch.</li><br>
        <li>After continuous attachment for several weeks, the joey becomes more active and gradually spends more and more time outside the pouch, which it leaves completely at 7 to 10 months of age.</li>
        <li>After only one week’s development, the microscopic embryo enters a dormant state, called diapause, that lasts until the first joey begins to leave the pouch or until conditions are otherwise favourable.</li> 
    </p><br><br>
    <img src="https://i.natgeofe.com/k/aa4c480f-89ec-4c21-97c3-4348a9c310bf/kangaroo-joey_4x3.jpg" alt="" srcset="" width="400" height="250px" ><br><br>
    <p>
        <li>Kangaroos have an irregular activity rhythm; generally, they are active at night and during periods of low light, but it is quite possible to find them out in the open in bright sunlight. During hot weather, kangaroos lick their forearms, which promotes heat loss by evaporation. Kangaroos travel and feed in groups (“mobs”) whose composition shifts, but they are not truly social, since the individual members move at liberty.</li><br>
        <li>In any mob, the largest male (“old man,” or “boomer”) dominates during the mating season. Males fight for access to females by biting, kicking, and boxing. These methods are also used by kangaroos to defend themselves against predators. With their agile arms, they can spar vigorously. They can also use the forepaws to grip an enemy while rocking back on their tails and then swiftly dropping their huge clawed hind feet.</li><br>
        <li>Overall, however, kangaroos have benefited from human presence. Aboriginal hunters regularly burned large areas of forest and grassland, opening up the country for large grazers at the expense of smaller browsers. European pastoralists then cleared further tracts of dense vegetation and provided permanent sources of water in arid and seasonal habitats. By the late 20th century, the number of kangaroos in Australia had increased to the point that a major industry came to be based on them.</li>

    <p>
        <li>Fox, any of various members of the dog family (Canidae) resembling small to medium-sized bushy-tailed dogs with long fur, pointed ears, and a narrow snout. In a restricted sense, the name refers to the 10 or so species classified as “true” foxes (genus Vulpes), especially the red, or common, fox (V. vulpes), which lives in both the Old World and the New World.</li><br>
        <li>Several other foxes belong to genera other than Vulpes, including the North American gray fox, five species of South American fox, the Arctic fox (including the blue fox), the bat-eared fox, and the crab-eating fox.</li>
        The red fox :-<br><br>
        <li>Widely held as a symbol of animal cunning, the red fox is the subject of considerable folklore. The red fox has the largest natural distribution of any land mammal except human beings. In the Old World it ranges over virtually all of Europe, temperate Asia, and northern Africa, and in the New World it inhabits most of North America.</li><br>
        <li>Introduced to Australia, it has established itself throughout much of that continent. The red fox has a coat of long guard hairs, soft fine underfur that is typically a rich reddish brown, often a white-tipped tail, and black ears and legs. Colour, however, is variable. In North America black and silver coats are found, with a variable amount of white or white-banded hair occurring in a black coat.</li>
    </p><br><br>
    <img src="https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/2022-09/fox-family-160125.jpg" alt="" srcset="" width="400" height="250px" ><br><br>
    <p>
        <li>The red fox is hunted for sport (see foxhunting) and for its pelt, which is a mainstay of the fur trade. Fox pelts, especially those of silver foxes, are commonly produced on fox farms, where the animals are raised until they are fully grown at approximately 10 months of age.</li><br>
        <li>In much of their range, red foxes are the primary carrier of rabies. Several countries, especially the United Kingdom and France, have extensive culling and vaccination programs aimed at reducing the incidence of rabies in red foxes.</li><br>
        <li>Fox populations in rural areas are often limited by the presence of coyotes, which hunt them. However, there is evidence that these species often coexist within urban areas by selecting different habitats. One study showed that foxes preferred areas that are more developed and manicured, such as residential neighbourhoods, athletic fields, and urban parks.</li><br>
        <li>They also showed a pattern of avoiding habitats that are more natural and less built, such as woodlots, open fields, and other forms of green space, which were frequented by coyotes.</li>
    </p><br><br>

    <p>
        <li>Red foxes mate in winter. After a gestation period of seven or eight weeks, the female (vixen) gives birth to 1–10 or more young (5 is average), called pups (or, less frequently, cubs or kits). Birth takes place in a den, which is commonly a burrow abandoned by another animal.</li><br>
        <li>It is often enlarged by the parent foxes. The cubs remain in the den for about five weeks and are cared for by both parents throughout the summer. The young disperse in the fall, once they are fully grown and independent.</li><br>
        <li>On the prairies of North America it is estimated that red foxes kill close to a million wild ducks each year. Their impact on domestic birds and some wild game birds has led to their numbers often being regulated near game farms and bird-production areas.</li>

        <li>It may come as a surprise to some but these are few of the only pure breeds that originate in India. There has been no human intervention in their breeding process, through any kind of selective breeding.</li><br> 
        <li>These homebred or the pure village dogs do need much maintenance and make adorable family pets if you socialize them early. You do not have to look any further to get one home, you can adopt one of the numerous puppies available around you in the streets or from the shelter and just give them a cosy home.</li><br>
        <li>Urbanisation has given rise to a lot of inter breeding, leading to the rise of many street dogs that you can see around you. Not all of the street dogs that you may see can be called Indian Pariah Dogs.</li>

    <p>
        <li>These dogs have a cautious temperament. These pure breds can adapt to any Indian weather, so you would not need to think much to bring them home. They are docile with the whole family and friendly with the kids though early socialization is the way to go with these naturally purebreds. One of the biggest advantages of this dog is that they are healthy and hardy breed.</li><br>
        <li>The Indian dog or the Indian Pariah dog is called by different names; they are called the pye dog, pie dog or the pi dog. These are naturally selected  breed in the Indian sub-continent. They are also referred to as INDog by many dog experts and enthusiasts alike. Whatever name they are called, they are one of the oldest and the smartest breed to belong to  the Indian soil.</li>

    <p>
        <li>The Indian Pariah dog as we discussed earlier has been present in the sub-continent for a long time. This has helped them to be one of the most adaptable dogs. These dogs have bred through natural selection and without any human intervention. This gives them a distinct features and all this without any human intervention.</li><br>
        <li>The Pariah dogs is one of the healthiest breeds around they are not prone to any specific medical conditions. So getting this breed will keep the vet bills to the minimum as they will be free of all allergies and most skin issues that some pedigree dogs are prone to.</li>

        CAT :<br><br>
        <li> We found 15 wild cats in the Indian subcontinent.</li><br> 
        <li>Warm-blooded feline, carnivorous mammal domesticated as a catcher of rats, mice and as a pet.</li><br> 
        <li> For adults:About 6-15 pounds (2.7 to 7 kilograms)Some cats weigh more than 20 pounds (9 kilograms).About 8-10 inches (20-25 cm) tall at the shoulder.</li><br>
        <li> Cats can drink seawater because, unlike humans, they can filter out salt and use the water content to hydrate their bodies.</li><br>
        <li> They can’t taste sweet things because they have a mutation in their taste receptors that prevents them from being able to taste sugar.</li>

    <p>
        <li> Cats can see in the dark, as they need one-sixth of the light level required for human vision.</li><br>
        <li> Cats purr at the same frequency as an idling diesel engine, which is about 26 purrs per second.</li><br>
        <li>Cats’ ears can hear ultrasonic sounds, which is what rodents use to communicate. Only cats can hear these sounds, not dogs or humans.</li><br>
        <li> Cats are made a bit like ragdolls, because their pelvis and shoulders are only loosely attached to the spine, which makes them flexible; that’s why they can squeeze into tight spaces.</li><br>
        <li> Cats are awake for only one third of the day – which averages to 16 hours a day of sleep. This is because they are carnivores and their body is nurtured for intense, brief bursts of energy to catch prey, followed by a meal, and then the necessity of a long period of rest to prepare for the next hunt.</li>

    <p>
        <li> Cats spend one third of their awake time grooming themselves.</li><br>
        <li>They use their mouths to smell things. When they smell something distinctive, they open their mouth slightly, crinkle their nose and pull back on the upper lip, performing what is known as the ‘Flehmen’ response.</li><br>
        <li> The barbs on their tongues are rear facing and help them lap up water and pull food into their mouths. This also helps them groom themselves effectively by pulling off loose fur and debris.</li><br>
        <li> They have whiskers everywhere, not just on their cheeks – but also the chin, eyebrows, and front legs.</li><br>
        <li> They walk and run on their toes, not their feet. Also, instead of a left-right or right-left movement, they move both left legs or both right legs simultaneously.</li>

    <h2>Donkey :</h2>
    <img src="https://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/donkey.jpg" alt="" srcset="" width="400" height="250px" ><br><br>

    <p>
        <li>The domestic donkey is a hoofed mammal in the family Equidae, the same family as the horse. It derives from the African wild ass, Equus africanus.A male donkey is known as a jack or jackass, a female is a jenny or jennet, and an immature donkey of either sex is a foal.</li><br>
        <li>Jacks are often mated with female horses (mares) to produce mules; the less common hybrid of a male horse (stallion) and jenny is a hinny.The animal finds use in places untouched by mechanisation, like brick kilns, where its small size helps it move quickly through narrow entrances.</li> 
    </p><br><br>
    <img src="https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/601159-donkey-1378540009/601159-donkey-1378540009.jpg" alt="" srcset="" width="400" height="250px" ><br><br>
    <p><li>Donkeys are not part of the income-generating milk, meat and fibre production systems in livestock farming. Slaughter of donkeys and trade of their meat and hide is illegal in India.Moreover, with more mechanisation across sectors, donkeys now find little use as load-carrying animals. The subsequent reduction in demand reflects in the huge decline in their population.</li><br>
       <li>In a 2019 study, Donkey Sanctuary India, which works for the welfare of the animal, notes that 4-10 million donkeys are likely slaughtered every year to fulfil demand for the skin in China.</li>

    <p>
        <li>According to the “20th Livestock Census” released in 2019, India has 0.12 million donkeys — 62 per cent lower than the 0.32 million recorded in 2012.Other equines — mules, horses and ponies — also saw a decrease in numbers, while the populations of cattle, buffaloes, sheep and goats rose in 2012-19.</li>

    <h2>Raccoon :</h2>

    <ul class="listcontent">
    <p>
        <li>The adult raccoon is a medium-sized mammal and the largest of the Procyonidae family.  It averages 24 to 38 inches in length and can weigh between 14 to 23 lbs., or more, depending upon habitat and available food. The male raccoon, or boar, is slightly larger than the female, also referred to as sow. The young are called kits.</li><br>
        <li>The mask of black fur that covers its eyes is its most characteristic and familiar feature. One hypothesis for the dark fur is that it may help reduce glare and enhance the nocturnal animal’s night vision. The species has grayish brown fur, almost 90% of which is dense underfur to insulate the animal against the cold. Five to eight light and dark rings alternate on its tail.</li>
    </p><br><br>
    <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/49/38549-004-4C172A4E/Raccoon-dogs.jpg" alt="" srcset="" width="400" height="250px" ><br><br>
    <p>
        <li>Because its hind legs are longer than the front legs, a raccoon often appears hunched when they walk or run. The five toes on a raccoon’s front paws are extremely dexterous, functioning essentially as five little fingers which allow it to grasp and manipulate food it finds in the wild as well as a variety of other objects, including doorknobs, jars, and latches.</li><br>
        <li>A raccoon’s most heightened sense is its sense of touch. It has very sensitive front paws and this sensitivity increases underwater. When able, a raccoon will examine objects in water.In the wild, a raccoon has a life expectancy of about 2 to 3 years, but in captivity, a raccoon can live up to 20 years.</li><br>
        <li>The species originally kept to the deciduous and mixed forests of North America, but its impressive ability to adapt has enabled the animal to move into a wide range of habitats, from mountainous terrains to large cities. The first urban sighting was in Cincinnati during the 1920s. Raccoon populations do very well in urban areas, primarily due to hunting and trapping restrictions, a general lack of predators, and an abundance of available human food. The size of a raccoon’s home range varies depending on habitat and food supply. In urban areas, its home range generally spans about one mile.</li>
    </p><br><br>

    <p>
        <li>The raccoon is an omnivorous and opportunistic eater, with its diet determined heavily by its environment. Common foods include fruits, plants, nuts, berries, insects, rodents, frogs, eggs, and crayfish. In urban environments, the animal often sifts through garbage for food. The majority of its diet consists of invertebrates and plant foods.</li><br>
        <li>The raccoon is native to North America and can be found throughout the United States, except for parts of the Rocky Mountains, and southwestern states like Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. It can also be found in parts of Canada, Mexico and the northern-most regions of South America. During the 20th century, the species was introduced to other parts of the globe, and now has an extensive presence in countries like Germany, Russia, and Japan.</li><br>
        <li>Originally raccoons lived in the tropics where they could be found foraging along riverbanks. Over time they moved north up the continent, successfully adapting to new territories and expanding their diet. Traditionally, they live in tree cavities or burrows emerging at dusk to hunt frogs and crustaceans while keeping an eye out for predators such as coyotes and foxes. Barns have aided their northern migration, offering refuge from cold northern winters, and now, raccoons have been found as far north as Alaska.</li>
